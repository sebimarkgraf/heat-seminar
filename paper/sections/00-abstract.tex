  Using unsupervised learning for datasets allows to extract information
  without the tedious task of labeling. Especially, on high-volume datasets
  this provides a potential benefit.

  For processing of high-volume datasets the power of a single machine is 
  not sufficient. By distributing the work this can be substantially be
  speedup. But due to the difficulty of writing distributed tasks
  this should be encapsulated into libraries that transparently split the
  data and work. 

  In this work we try to use HeAT on remote sensing data to find a classification
  without using the labels. The result is then evaluated against the provided
  labels.

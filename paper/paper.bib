	abstract = {We present HeAT, a scientiﬁc big data library supporting transparent computation on HPC systems. HeAT builds on top of PyTorch, which already provides many required features like automatic differentiation, CPU and GPU support, linear algebra operations and basic MPI functionality as well as an imperative programming paradigm allowing fast prototyping essential in scientiﬁc research. These features are generalized to a distributed tensor with a NumPy-like interface allowing to port existing NumPy algorithms to HPC systems nearly effortlessly.},

	abstract = {In order to cope with the exponential growth in available data, the efﬁciency of data analysis and machine learning libraries have recently received increased attention. Although corresponding array-based numerical kernels have been signiﬁcantly improved, most are limited by the resources available on a single computational node. Consequently, kernels must exploit distributed resources, e.g., distributed memory architectures. To this end, we introduce HeAT, an array-based numerical programming framework for large-scale parallel processing with an easy-to-use NumPy-like API. HeAT utilizes PyTorch as a nodelocal eager execution engine and distributes the workload via MPI on arbitrarily large high-performance computing systems. It provides both low-level array-based computations, as well as assorted higher-level algorithms. With HeAT, it is possible for a NumPy user to take advantage of their available resources, signiﬁcantly lowering the barrier to distributed data analysis. Compared with applications written in similar frameworks, HeAT achieves speedups of up to two orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {This article was submitted to IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine. Access to labeled reference data is one of the grand challenges in supervised machine learning endeavors. This is especially true for an automated analysis of remote sensing images on a global scale, which enables us to address global challenges such as urbanization and climate change using state-of-theart machine learning techniques. To meet these pressing needs, especially in urban research, we provide open access to a valuable benchmark dataset named “So2Sat LCZ42,” which consists of local climate zone (LCZ) labels of about half a million Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches in 42 urban agglomerations (plus 10 additional smaller areas) across the globe. This dataset was labeled by 15 domain experts following a carefully designed labeling work ﬂow and evaluation process over a period of six months. As rarely done in other labeled remote sensing dataset, we conducted rigorous quality assessment by domain experts. The dataset achieved an overall conﬁdence of 85\%. We believe this LCZ dataset is a ﬁrst step towards an unbiased globallydistributed dataset for urban growth monitoring using machine learning methods, because LCZ provide a rather objective measure other than many other semantic land use and land cover classiﬁcations. It provides measures of the morphology, compactness, and height of urban areas, which are less dependent on human and culture. This dataset can be accessed from http://doi.org/10.14459/2018mp1483140.},

A collection of experiments is presented involving clustering hierarchies of different natures, a variety of real data sets, and comparisons with specialized methods from the literature.},

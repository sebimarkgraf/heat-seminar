	abstract = {In order to cope with the exponential growth in available data, the efﬁciency of data analysis and machine learning libraries have recently received increased attention. Although corresponding array-based numerical kernels have been signiﬁcantly improved, most are limited by the resources available on a single computational node. Consequently, kernels must exploit distributed resources, e.g., distributed memory architectures. To this end, we introduce HeAT, an array-based numerical programming framework for large-scale parallel processing with an easy-to-use NumPy-like API. HeAT utilizes PyTorch as a nodelocal eager execution engine and distributes the workload via MPI on arbitrarily large high-performance computing systems. It provides both low-level array-based computations, as well as assorted higher-level algorithms. With HeAT, it is possible for a NumPy user to take advantage of their available resources, signiﬁcantly lowering the barrier to distributed data analysis. Compared with applications written in similar frameworks, HeAT achieves speedups of up to two orders of magnitude.},

This is especially true for an automated analysis of remote sensing images on a global scale, which enables us to address global challenges such as urbanization and climate change using state-of-theart machine learning techniques. To meet these pressing needs, especially in urban research, we provide open access to a valuable benchmark dataset named “So2Sat LCZ42,” which consists of local climate zone (LCZ) labels of about half a million Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches in 42 urban agglomerations (plus 10 additional smaller areas) across the globe. This dataset was labeled by 15 domain experts following a carefully designed labeling work ﬂow and evaluation process over a period of six months. As rarely done in other labeled remote sensing dataset, we conducted rigorous quality assessment by domain experts. The dataset achieved an overall conﬁdence of 85\%. We believe this LCZ dataset is a ﬁrst step towards an unbiased globallydistributed dataset for urban growth monitoring using machine learning methods, because LCZ provide a rather objective measure other than many other semantic land use and land cover classiﬁcations. It provides measures of the morphology, compactness, and height of urban areas, which are less dependent on human and culture.

These methods are important components of many scientific numerical algorithms and have been demonstrated by experiment to work extremely well. In this paper, we show that spectral partitioning methods work well on bounded-degree planar graphs and finite element meshes-the classes of graphs to which they are usually applied. While active spectral bisection does not necessarily work, we prove that spectral partitioning techniques can be used to produce separators whose ratio of vertices removed to edges cut is O(/spl radic/n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and two-dimensional meshes and O(n/sup 1/d/) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes. The heart of our analysis is an upper bound on the second-smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrices of these graphs: we prove a bound of O(1/n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and O(1/n/sup 2/d/) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes.},

	abstract = {Although clustering has been studied for several decades, the fundamental problem of a valid evaluation has not yet been solved. The sound evaluation of clustering results in particular on real data is inherently diﬃcult. In the literature, new clustering algorithms and their results are often externally evaluated with respect to an existing class labeling. These class-labels, however, may not be adequate for the structure of the data or the evaluated cluster model. Here, we survey the literature of diﬀerent related research areas that have observed this problem. We discuss common “defects” that clustering algorithms exhibit w.r.t. this evaluation, and show them on several real world data sets of diﬀerent domains along with a discussion why the detected clusters do not indicate a bad performance of the algorithm but are valid and useful results. An useful alternative evaluation method requires more extensive data labeling than the commonly used class labels or it needs a combination of information measures to take subgroups, supergroups, and overlapping sets of traditional classes into account. Finally, we discuss an evaluation scenario that regards the possible existence of several complementary sets of labels and hope to stimulate the discussion among diﬀerent sub-communities — like ensemble-clustering, subspace-clustering, multi-label classiﬁcation, hierarchical classiﬁcation or hierarchical clustering, and multiview-clustering or alternative clustering —regarding requirements on enhanced evaluation methods.},

As a result, research insights gained in urban climate study can be applied to improve urban sustainability. Although the Local Climate Zones (LCZ) scheme was originally proposed to provide a standardized classiﬁcation of landscapes to study urban air temperature, its use was not limited to the study of urban heat islands. This study explores the applications of LCZ scheme in various research domains by conducting a bibliometric analysis in CiteSpace on over 800 articles that cites the original article of LCZ. These articles cover a wide range of research categories including meteorology, atmospheric science, environmental science, remote sensing, building technology, civil engineering, ecology, urban studies, etc. The LCZ scheme facilitates urban climate data collection by reﬁning monitoring network, providing reasonable modelling input, and improving database documentation. In addition to the study of urban heat islands, the LCZ scheme was applied in studies of urban thermal comfort, human health, building energy consumption, and carbon emission. The diﬀusion of the LCZ scheme to other research domains oﬀers an example that the development of urban climate research advances sustainable urban development. This review provides insights of multidisciplinary studies related to urban climate for policy-makers, urban specialists, architects, ecologists, and others.},

Observations of urban–rural air temperature differences—or urban heat islands (UHIs)—have been reported for cities and regions worldwide, often with local field sites that are extremely diverse in their physical and climatological characteristics. These sites are usually described only as “urban” or “rural,” leaving much uncertainty about the actual exposure and land cover of the sites. To address the inadequacies of urban–rural description, the “local climate zone” (LCZ) classification system has been developed. The LCZ system comprises 17 zone types at the local scale (10$^{\textrm{2}}$ to 10$^{\textrm{4}}$ m). Each type is unique in its combination of surface structure, cover, and human activity. Classification of sites into appropriate LCZs requires basic metadata and surface characterization. The zone definitions provide a standard framework for reporting and comparing field sites and their temperature observations. The LCZ system is designed primarily for urban heat island researchers, but it has derivative uses for city planners, landscape ecologists, and global climate change investigators.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {NumPy is a popular Python library used for performing arraybased numerical computations. The canonical implementation of NumPy used by most programmers runs on a single CPU core and is parallelized to use multiple cores for some operations. This restriction to a single-node CPU-only execution limits both the size of data that can be handled and the potential speed of NumPy code. In this work we introduce Legate, a drop-in replacement for NumPy that requires only a single-line code change and can scale up to an arbitrary number of GPU accelerated nodes. Legate works by translating NumPy programs to the Legion programming model and then leverages the scalability of the Legion runtime system to distribute data and computations across an arbitrary sized machine. Compared to similar programs written in the distributed Dask array library in Python, Legate achieves speed-ups of up to 10X on 1280 CPUs and 100X on 256 GPUs.},

	abstract = {Application programmers in domains like machine learning, scientiﬁc computing, and computational biology are accustomed to using powerful, high productivity array languages such as MatLab, R and NumPy. Distributed array frameworks aim to scale array programs across machines. However, maximizing the locality of access to distributed arrays is an unsolved problem; such locality is critical for high performance. This paper presents Spartan, a distributed array framework that automatically determines how to best partition (aka “tile”) ndimensional arrays and to co-locate data with computation to maximize locality. Spartan combines a lazy-evaluation based, optimizing frontend with a distributed tiled array backend. Central to Spartan’s design is a small number of carefully chosen parallel high-level operators, which form the expression graph captured by Spartan’s frontend during runtime. These operators simplify the programming of distributed applications. More importantly, their well-deﬁned semantics allow Spartan’s runtime to calculate the costs of different tiling strategies and pick the best one for evaluating the entire expression graph.},

The terminology and procedures of the two are compared and it is concluded that there is a close similarity except that there is no direct analogy in regionalization with the individual of classification. It is suggested that operationally defined individuals partially overcome this problem. The histories of ideas about the nature and purpose of regional systems and classification systems are briefly compared and again found to be similar. Ten principles of classification derived from the work of logicians and taxonomists are then stated and the methods of constructing regional systems are examined in the light of these principles. It is shown that most of the points revealed by such an examination have been previously discussed by geographers, although they are arguing from different premises. Some of the principles, however, do raise problems which have hitherto received little attention.},

V-measure provides an elegant solution to many problems that affect previously defined cluster evaluation measures including 1) dependence on clustering algorithm or data set, 2) the "problem of matching", where the clustering of only a portion of data points are evaluated and 3) accurate evaluation and combination of two desirable aspects of clustering, homogeneity and completeness. We compare V-measure to a number of popular cluster evaluation measures and demonstrate that it satisfies several desirable properties of clustering solutions, using simulated clustering results. Finally, we use V-measure to evaluate two clustering tasks: document clustering and pitch accent type clustering.},

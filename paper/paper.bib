	abstract = {We present HeAT, a scientiﬁc big data library supporting transparent computation on HPC systems. HeAT builds on top of PyTorch, which already provides many required features like automatic differentiation, CPU and GPU support, linear algebra operations and basic MPI functionality as well as an imperative programming paradigm allowing fast prototyping essential in scientiﬁc research. These features are generalized to a distributed tensor with a NumPy-like interface allowing to port existing NumPy algorithms to HPC systems nearly effortlessly.},

	abstract = {In order to cope with the exponential growth in available data, the efﬁciency of data analysis and machine learning libraries have recently received increased attention. Although corresponding array-based numerical kernels have been signiﬁcantly improved, most are limited by the resources available on a single computational node. Consequently, kernels must exploit distributed resources, e.g., distributed memory architectures. To this end, we introduce HeAT, an array-based numerical programming framework for large-scale parallel processing with an easy-to-use NumPy-like API. HeAT utilizes PyTorch as a nodelocal eager execution engine and distributes the workload via MPI on arbitrarily large high-performance computing systems. It provides both low-level array-based computations, as well as assorted higher-level algorithms. With HeAT, it is possible for a NumPy user to take advantage of their available resources, signiﬁcantly lowering the barrier to distributed data analysis. Compared with applications written in similar frameworks, HeAT achieves speedups of up to two orders of magnitude.},

This is especially true for an automated analysis of remote sensing images on a global scale, which enables us to address global challenges such as urbanization and climate change using state-of-theart machine learning techniques. To meet these pressing needs, especially in urban research, we provide open access to a valuable benchmark dataset named “So2Sat LCZ42,” which consists of local climate zone (LCZ) labels of about half a million Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches in 42 urban agglomerations (plus 10 additional smaller areas) across the globe. This dataset was labeled by 15 domain experts following a carefully designed labeling work ﬂow and evaluation process over a period of six months. As rarely done in other labeled remote sensing dataset, we conducted rigorous quality assessment by domain experts. The dataset achieved an overall conﬁdence of 85\%. We believe this LCZ dataset is a ﬁrst step towards an unbiased globallydistributed dataset for urban growth monitoring using machine learning methods, because LCZ provide a rather objective measure other than many other semantic land use and land cover classiﬁcations. It provides measures of the morphology, compactness, and height of urban areas, which are less dependent on human and culture. This dataset can be accessed from http://doi.org/10.14459/2018mp1483140.},

These methods are important components of many scientific numerical algorithms and have been demonstrated by experiment to work extremely well. In this paper, we show that spectral partitioning methods work well on bounded-degree planar graphs and finite element meshes-the classes of graphs to which they are usually applied. While active spectral bisection does not necessarily work, we prove that spectral partitioning techniques can be used to produce separators whose ratio of vertices removed to edges cut is O(/spl radic/n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and two-dimensional meshes and O(n/sup 1/d/) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes. The heart of our analysis is an upper bound on the second-smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrices of these graphs: we prove a bound of O(1/n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and O(1/n/sup 2/d/) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes.},

	abstract = {Although clustering has been studied for several decades, the fundamental problem of a valid evaluation has not yet been solved. The sound evaluation of clustering results in particular on real data is inherently diﬃcult. In the literature, new clustering algorithms and their results are often externally evaluated with respect to an existing class labeling. These class-labels, however, may not be adequate for the structure of the data or the evaluated cluster model. Here, we survey the literature of diﬀerent related research areas that have observed this problem. We discuss common “defects” that clustering algorithms exhibit w.r.t. this evaluation, and show them on several real world data sets of diﬀerent domains along with a discussion why the detected clusters do not indicate a bad performance of the algorithm but are valid and useful results. An useful alternative evaluation method requires more extensive data labeling than the commonly used class labels or it needs a combination of information measures to take subgroups, supergroups, and overlapping sets of traditional classes into account. Finally, we discuss an evaluation scenario that regards the possible existence of several complementary sets of labels and hope to stimulate the discussion among diﬀerent sub-communities — like ensemble-clustering, subspace-clustering, multi-label classiﬁcation, hierarchical classiﬁcation or hierarchical clustering, and multiview-clustering or alternative clustering —regarding requirements on enhanced evaluation methods.},

The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe diﬀerent graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several diﬀerent approaches.
